Openscad files for corexz project

This is very much a work in progress.  The vitamins I used are:
	- 80/20 series 2020 aluminum extrusions.  These measure 20mm x 20mm.
	- The T nuts were purchased from openbuilds.com as were the
	- V wheels I use for pulleys.
	- The guitar tuners were purchased through amazon at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0099DMFK2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

The Y axis is not fully worked out.  I need to decide whether I am staying with the traction drive or going back to the spool drive.
Once this decision is made, I'll know the location of the strings and I'll design the Y axis around them.

I have also not yet decided on an extruder.  I want to run dual extruder and am presently leaning towards these: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:158530,
although I will need to work out my own carrier for them
